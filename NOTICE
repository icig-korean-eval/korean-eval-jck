Modifications by K1A2:
The model was fine-tuned to convert Korean speech audio
into International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions using the following datasets:

1. News Scripts and Anchor Speech Dataset (AI Hub)  
   - A high-quality Korean speech dataset by professional announcers.  
   - Source: https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=data&dataSetSn=71557  

2. Korean Speech Dataset (AI Hub)  
   - A general-purpose Korean speech dataset with various speakers and natural pronunciation.  
   - Source: https://www.aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=&topMenu=&aihubDataSe=data&dataSetSn=123  

These datasets were used to fine-tune the model to output IPA phoneme sequences corresponding to the Korean speech inputs.  
The resulting model supports phonetic transcription tasks for both professional and general Korean speech.
